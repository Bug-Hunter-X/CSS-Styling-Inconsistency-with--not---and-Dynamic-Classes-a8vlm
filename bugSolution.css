A more robust and less error-prone approach is to avoid the `:not()` pseudo-class in cases involving rapidly changing classes.  Instead of negatively selecting elements, style the elements directly.
```css
.container { background-color: lightgray; }
.highlight { background-color: yellow; }
```
This method is simpler, more efficient, and less prone to rendering inconsistencies. It also might have better performance in browsers, especially with many elements.
